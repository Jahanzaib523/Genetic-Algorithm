
values of n w s are defined globally
a random function is used to initialize them

then there is a method Read() which is called used 
to read data from csv file and store in variables

read method will only be called when a variable generate
is set true otherwise initialize_knapsack_table will be called
 
for crossover probability small changes have been made 
like creating separate variable for storing probability and 
after that it is used in loop to crossover only the required 
number of times

Then for tournament selection
a global variable is initialize to take subset of population
in method tournament() a small subset is taken and best cromosome is chosen


for plots I have changed some called main method multiple times
but with different values of Mutation and Crossover probability
and a graph is ploted.
